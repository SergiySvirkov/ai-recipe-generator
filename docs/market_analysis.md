2. Analysis of Strengths and Weaknesses

<!-- A brief analysis of each competitor to understand their market position. -->

Yummly & SuperCook: Their strength is generating recipes by ingredients. However, they mostly search for existing recipes in their database, rather than creating something completely new. Yummly’s personalization is based on likes, but does not allow for flexible control over the generation process.

Allrecipes & Kitchen Stories: These are content platforms. Their strength lies in their huge database of proven recipes and high-quality presentation. They don’t generate recipes, but work like a big cookbook.

Mealime: Strongly focused on planning. It’s not about creativity, but about efficiency and health. There’s no “on the fly” generation.

Paprika: This is a tool for organization, not creativity. The user fills their database themselves.

3. Identifying the Market Niche & Project Opportunity

<!-- This section defines our unique selling proposition based on the market gaps. -->

The analysis shows that none of the popular platforms focuses on generating truly new, unique recipes using AI. Most services work as smart search engines based on the existing database.

Our Niche:

To create a platform that doesn’t just find a recipe, but invents it, combining ingredients, cuisine styles, and cooking techniques in unexpected but logical ways.

Key features for our project:

True AI generation: Unlike our competitors, our main function is to create recipes "from scratch" using generative models (like GPT), and not search the database. This will allow us to get unique results that are not found anywhere else.

Deep personalization: We can go beyond standard dietary filters. Our AI can take into account:

User's mood ("I want something cozy and warming" or "I need a quick energy boost").

Available time ("15-minute recipe").

Cooking skill level ("beginner's recipe").

Preferred cuisine style ("make something Asian-style with chicken and rice").

Creative tool: Position the application not just as an assistant, but as a source of inspiration for culinary experiments.

Conclusion: The market is overflowing with recipe organizers and databases. There is a clear unfilled niche for a creative AI tool that acts as a "chef-co-author." This is what we will focus on when developing the MVP.
