Phase 1: MVP Requirements Specification

<!-- This document formalizes the functional and non-functional requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the AI Recipe Generator. Its purpose is to create a clear, shared understanding of the project's scope for the initial release. -->
1. Introduction & MVP Goals

The primary goal of the MVP is to validate the core concept: the ability of an AI to generate unique, coherent, and useful recipes based on user-provided ingredients and a single dietary constraint.

The MVP will focus exclusively on delivering this core value proposition in the simplest possible way, laying the foundation for future features and enhancements.
2. Functional Requirements (FR)

<!-- Functional requirements describe what the system must do. -->
FR-1: Core Recipe Generation

    Description: The user must be able to generate a recipe by providing a list of ingredients.

    User Story: As a user, I want to input the ingredients I have at home so that I can get a recipe idea and avoid wasting food.

    Acceptance Criteria:

        The user interface (UI) must provide a text input field to list ingredients.

        The user can input 1 to 5 ingredients for the MVP.

        Upon submitting the request, the system must generate a single, complete recipe.

        The generated recipe must contain three distinct parts:

            A plausible Title.

            A list of Ingredients (including quantities and units).

            A sequence of step-by-step cooking Instructions.

FR-2: Dietary Constraint Filter

    Description: The user must be able to apply a single dietary filter to the recipe generation process.

    User Story: As a user with dietary needs, I want to specify my restriction (e.g., "vegan") to ensure the generated recipe is suitable for me.

    Acceptance Criteria:

        The UI must provide a simple way to select one dietary option from a predefined list (e.g., a dropdown menu).

        The initial list of options for the MVP will be: None, Vegetarian, Vegan.

        The AI-generated recipe must strictly adhere to the selected dietary constraint. For instance, a "Vegan" recipe must not contain any meat, dairy, or other animal products.

3. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

<!-- Non-functional requirements describe how the system should perform its functions. -->
NFR-1: Performance

    Description: The system must generate and display a recipe in a timely manner.

    Requirement: The end-to-end time from the user clicking "Generate" to the recipe being displayed on the screen should be under 15 seconds.

NFR-2: Usability

    Description: The user interface must be intuitive and easy to use without any instructions.

    Requirement: A first-time user should be able to understand how to generate a recipe within 30 seconds of landing on the page. The UI should be clean, uncluttered, and focused on the core generation feature.

NFR-3: Reliability

    Description: The system should remain stable and handle potential errors gracefully.

    Requirement: In case the AI fails to generate a valid recipe, the user should be shown a clear, user-friendly error message (e.g., "Sorry, we couldn't generate a recipe this time. Please try again with different ingredients.") instead of a technical error code.

NFR-4: Compatibility

    Description: The web application must be accessible on modern web browsers.

    Requirement: The application must render and function correctly on the latest versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari.

4. Out of Scope for MVP

<!-- This section explicitly lists features that will NOT be included in the initial release. This is critical for managing scope and expectations. -->

The following features are intentionally excluded from the MVP to ensure a focused and timely launch. They may be considered for future versions.

    User Accounts & Authentication: The MVP will be fully anonymous. There will be no registration, login, or user profiles.

    Saving or Rating Recipes: Users will not be able to save, bookmark, rate, or comment on generated recipes.

    Advanced Personalization: Generation based on mood, cooking time, skill level, or specific cuisines is not part of the MVP.

    Shopping List Generation: The application will not create a shopping list from the recipe.

    Nutritional Information: No calculation or display of calories, macronutrients, or other nutritional data.

    Multiple Language Support: The interface and generated recipes will be in a single language only (English).

    Image Generation: The MVP will not generate images of the food.

    Recipe History: The application will not store a history of previously generated recipes for the user.
