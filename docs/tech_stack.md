Phase 1: Technology Stack Specification

<!-- This document outlines the definitive technology stack chosen for the AI Recipe Generator MVP. Each choice is justified based on the project's specific requirements, focusing on rapid development, scalability, and leveraging existing open-source ecosystems. -->
1. Guiding Principles for Technology Selection

Our technology choices are guided by the following principles:

    Speed to MVP: Prioritize technologies that allow for fast iteration and development to validate the core product idea quickly.

    Scalability: While focusing on the MVP, choose technologies that have a clear path for scaling as the user base grows.

    Community & Ecosystem: Select tools with strong community support, extensive documentation, and a rich ecosystem of libraries to avoid reinventing the wheel.

    Cost-Effectiveness: Utilize free tiers and open-source software to minimize initial infrastructure costs.

3. Detailed Breakdown
3.1. Backend: Flask

    Framework: Flask will be used for building the RESTful API.

    Reasoning:

        Micro-framework: Flask is unopinionated and lightweight, which means we only add the components we need (like SQLAlchemy for the database or Flask-RESTful for APIs). This leads to less boilerplate code and faster initial setup compared to a full-featured framework like Django.

        Ideal for APIs: It is perfectly suited for creating the API endpoints that our React frontend will consume.

        Python Ecosystem: It allows us to seamlessly integrate with the Python-based AI/ML stack (Hugging Face).

3.2. Frontend: React

    Framework: React will be used for building the user interface.

    Reasoning:

        Component-Based: Allows us to build encapsulated components (like IngredientInputForm, RecipeDisplay) that manage their own state, making the UI easier to build, manage, and debug.

        Rich Ecosystem: We can leverage a vast number of libraries for state management (like Redux Toolkit or Zustand), routing, and UI components (like Material-UI or Shadcn/ui), accelerating development.

        Strong Community: Finding solutions to problems and hiring developers is easier due to React's immense popularity.

3.3. Database: SQLite -> PostgreSQL

    MVP Database: SQLite.

    Reasoning: For the MVP, we don't need a complex database setup. SQLite is a serverless, self-contained database engine that stores data in a single file. This is perfect for local development and the initial Heroku deployment, as it requires zero configuration. The file (dev.db) will be included in .gitignore.

    Production Database: PostgreSQL.

    Reasoning: As the application grows, we will need a more robust and scalable solution. PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system with a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. The migration path from SQLite is well-documented, especially when using an ORM like SQLAlchemy.

3.4. AI / Machine Learning: Hugging Face Transformers

    Library: The transformers library by Hugging Face will be our primary tool for recipe generation.

    Reasoning:

        Access to Pre-trained Models: Building a large language model from scratch is a multi-year, multi-million dollar effort. The transformers library gives us immediate access to powerful, pre-trained models like GPT-2, T5, or newer, smaller alternatives.

        Fine-Tuning Capability: We can take a pre-trained model and "fine-tune" it on our own dataset of recipes. This will teach the model the specific structure and style of a recipe, leading to much higher-quality generation.

        Simplified API: The library provides a high-level API for loading models, tokenizing text, and running inference (generation), abstracting away much of the underlying complexity of PyTorch or TensorFlow.

3.5. Deployment: Vercel & Heroku

    Frontend Deployment: Vercel.

    Reasoning: Vercel is built by the creators of Next.js (a React framework) and offers first-class support for deploying React applications. Its key advantages are seamless integration with GitHub (auto-deploys on every push to main), a global CDN for fast load times, and a generous free tier perfect for an MVP.

    Backend Deployment: Heroku.

    Reasoning: Heroku is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that makes deploying web applications incredibly simple. It has excellent support for Python/Flask apps. We can deploy our API with a git push command, and Heroku will handle the server provisioning, dependency installation (via requirements.txt), and routing. Its free tier is sufficient for the initial MVP traffic.
